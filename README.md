Triangle Problem
================

This is my solution to the triangle problem, which is formalized as follows.

_Given a triangle $t$, find a maximum path through $t$. _

In other words, find the path, starting from the tip of the triangle $t$ down
to the bottom, where the sum of the nodes along the way is the maximum
of any possible path taken.
